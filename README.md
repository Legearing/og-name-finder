# og-name-finder

helps find a pog og name for your cool minecraft account

this script just uses a random word picker and checks if an account with that name exists. 
i added a compiled version for windows, but if you dont trust me you can just use the uncompiled version. you need python and the "requests" library
its a pretty straight forward prgram. i dont really have anything to say
